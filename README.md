A Portuguese bank had experienced a revenue decline. It was found the root cause is that bank’s customers are not depositing as frequently as before. 
A term deposits benefits a bank in the following way:
•	It can invest the deposits in those financial products which lead to higher gain; to make a profit which is higher than the cost associated with deposits. 
•	Secondly, more the term deposit customers higher is the probability that a bank can upsell or cross sell other products to further increase revenues. 
Hence, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and thus focus marketing effort on such clients.
